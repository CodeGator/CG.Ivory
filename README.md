### What does it do?

Ivory is an idea for an EFCORE based DAL that can switch between providers without requiring a recompile. The project also isolates the migrations to their respective provider assemblies, so everything just works, at runtime.

### What platform(s) does it support?

* [.NET 7.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) or higher
